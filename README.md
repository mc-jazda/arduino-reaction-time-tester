# Reaction Time Tester based on Arduino
## Overview

This is a simple Arduino Uno project that simulates standing start procedure in Formula 1. If user presses a button, five LEDs light up sequentially. Once all LEDs are on, then after previously randomly selected time period they all turn off simultaneously. At this moment, the user should press the button again as quickly as possible. The time taken to do so after the LEDs go off is displayed on the LCD.
This project was my introduction to developing Arduino based projects and soldering.

## Used hardware

- Arduino Uno,
- 16x2 LCD with HD44780 chipset,
- 5kΩ potentiometer,
- five LEDs,
